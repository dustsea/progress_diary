# The First Diary On My Github
I'd like to try my best to earn the master's degree of Computer science and technology at zhejiang university.  
So I must study harder and harder to achieve my goal.  
Then I use Github to document my studies.  
I will record what I have learned today and remark my performance in the day and make proper plan for tomorrow.  
As for today's tasks.  
I must keep away from temptation and concentrate myself on studying.

注意事项：Github上markdown回车并不能显示出来，要在后面加两个空格
